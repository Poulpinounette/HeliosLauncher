      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hi everyone, <br />
We're now approaching the half way point of the year (alarmingly) quickly, which is usually when about we hold a mid-year building contest.<br />
<br />
The level of engagement/interest in building contests has gone up and down over the years. Before we launch another one we thought it might be a good time to gauge community attitudes  to see if there's any way they could be improved (better prizes/different format) and to get your thoughts and ideas on other community events we could run. <br />
<br />
We've put together a quick anonymous and private survey with some questions about events, contests and prizes. Feel free to answer as many/little as you like. Any ideas would be much appreciated.<br />
 <br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Dear Community,<br />
<br />
due to the steep increase in new builders (welcome to the team!) and an overall lack of available plots, the mods have decided that from now on, build plots shall be rationed.<br />
This is to assure that everyone, but especially our newest members, has equal opportunity to build. From today on, and until further notice, every builder is allowed 2 low class houses OR 1 middle class house OR 1 special plot per week. We will be monitoring the development of this new rule, any infractions will be met with swift justice.<br />
<br />
Enjoy building!<br />

<br />
Yay more forms! Have I told you I love making forum forms? (try saying that ten times fast)<br />
<br />
In light of recent events it occurred to me that I could make a form which submits entirely anonymous feedback. After running it by the moderators I've just implemented it. You can find it <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/form/" class="link link--internal">here</a> listed with the other forms. Please read the header text on the form before submitting. <br />
<br />
Please note that currently the form is only open to those with builder rank and above.</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">I figure people should be aware of Mojang migrating their accounts to Microsoft. As any new account made after December 1st will need to be Microsoft and there for people will be and are having issues getting our launcher to work. For those with Mojang accounts be aware you will have to go through the migration process starting early 2021 to switch to Microsoft or be locked out of your account. Just be aware of them emailing you with information on how to do so. All the information you need about the migration process is below.<br />

      <title>Chat, Discord and Forum Rules Reminder</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">This is a busy time of year for Westeros. We have lots of builds underway, an active base of regular builders as well as a rush of new builders learning the ropes. We thought we should take this opportunity to remind our members of the Westeroscraft in-game chat, Discord and forum rules.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://westeroscraft.com/wiki/miscellaneous/server-rules" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><b>Rules for In-Game Chat, Discord and the Forums</b></a><br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px"><b>1. No racist, sexist, homophobic or any other prejudiced comments or insults.</b> If you think you probably shouldn't say something, then don't.&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><b>2. Show and book spoilers are permitted in discussion</b>. Press F1 to hide chat if you want to avoid spoilers. Intentionally spoiling someone's experience is a ban worthy offense.&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px">&#8203;</div><div style="margin-left: 20px"><b>3. No spamming the chat.</b> This includes, but is not limited to: sending a lot of messages, talking in all caps, and spamming characters (i.e. AAAAAAAAAAAAA).No advertising other servers or trying to recruit players on our server.&#8203;</div><br />
<b>The Golden Rule</b><br />
<br />
<div style="margin-left: 20px">Don't be an asshat. This single rule covers it all. Treat others as you would like to be treated.&#8203;</div><br />
All builders are expected to read these rules and guidelines when they first apply to join and to remember them during their career on the server. With the exception of the Spoiler Rule, they haven’t really changed since the server was founded almost 10 years ago.<br />
<br />
The Mods request that all builders keep them in mind when hanging out in game, using the public discord and posting on the forum.<br />
<br />
We have zero interest in being the fun police or censoring memes or friendly banter. We know the memes are great. But we do ask that builders check themselves when flooding the chat with in-jokes, overtly sexual/intentionally crass, all caps, or random, pointless spam looking for a reaction. While this stuff can be funny or harmless to you, the most extreme examples of it are off putting, potentially alienating and risks giving guests the wrong impression of our server when read without context.<br />
<br />
This post hasn't been prompted by a specific incident, and we don’t believe that anyone has really stepped over the line yet (or at least anyone who hasn’t already been warned about it), but we want this post to remind everyone that the line exists, and we want to reign things in before someone accidently steps over it and genuinely causes harm. Mods will be stepping in more to privately call out this behavior when they see it or its reported.<br />
<br />
Nobody’s perfect, and on the Internet it’s easy to be misconstrued, but we expect everyone to make a good faith effort. Your behaviour does leave an impression, so please make it a positive one.</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Block Request Form</title>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Jan 2021 17:41:36 +0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://forum.westeroscraft.com/threads/new-block-request-form.2602/</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
As many of you might have noticed by now, we've been testing a new form for allowing people to make block suggestions in a more organized way. I'm happy to announce that this form should now officially be live, thanks to the efforts of <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/8873/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="8873" data-username="DutchGuard">DutchGuard</a> and <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/23/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="23" data-username="Thamus_Knoward">Thamus_Knoward</a> ! We're hoping that this change should streamline the process and make it more transparent.<br />
<br />
The form, which will only be available to builders, can be accessed by clicking on &quot;FORMS&quot; in the navigation bar, and then &quot;Block Request Form&quot;. Upon submitting the form, a thread will automatically be created in the subforum &quot;Art &amp; Content Creation/Textures &amp; Models/Pending Block Requests&quot;. A member of the texture team may further categorize the request according to various &quot;workload&quot; and &quot;desirability&quot; tags, and calculate a priority for the request accordingly. To ensure consideration for your request, please make sure to provide as much detail for your suggestion as possible - the more work you can take off our backs by thoroughly researching the request and thinking through the possible ramifications of the addition, the better. If taken up, a thread will be moved to the &quot;In Progress Block Requests&quot; subforum when under development, and into the &quot;Completed Block Requests&quot; subforum when finished.<br />
<br />
The Texture Pack Megathread may still be used for open-ended discussion, but as of now, any official block requests should be made through the form to be considered. Please also make sure to check the subforums before making a request, to see if somebody else already suggested the same thing!<br />
<br />
Finally, we also ask that you <b>please re-submit any requests that were made since the last official block update using the new system</b>. We will eventually port all pending suggestions from Asana to the new system, but would certainly appreciate your help in making this transfer quicker.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if any issues come up with using the new system!<br />
- The Texture Team</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hopefully you’re getting snug under a blanket with a mug of hot chocolate (or beating the heat with a chilled beverage down south) because we have some exciting news. Not only are we announcing a contest just in time for the holiday season, but we are announcing <b>THREE CONTESTS</b>!<br />
<br />
Along with holding a traditional <b>building contest</b>, we are bringing back the <b>Westeros Captured screenshot contest</b> and introducing a brand new <b>fan art contest</b> (unless you were around for the one we held way back in 2015)!!!<br />
<br />
The theme for all three contests is <b>“cozy comforts,”</b> which the mods have decided is free for you to interpret however you want! From relaxing by a fire to picking flowers in a meadow to brewing potions in a little woodsy cottage, you can take this theme absolutely anywhere.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/attachments/cozycomforts-copy-png.5840/"
		target="_blank"><img src="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/data/attachments/5/5840-bd8389d3a3a33788e716f5d934603a16.jpg"
		class="bbImage "
		style=""
		alt="cozycomforts copy.png"
		title="cozycomforts copy.png"
		width="100" height="63" loading="lazy" /></a>&#8203;</div><br />
Here are some basic rules:<br />
All three contests will start <b>Wednesday, 11th of November, at 12am EST</b> (5:00 GMT), and they will end on the <b>26th of December at 11:59pm EST</b> (27th of December, 4:59 GMT) with the winners revealed in the Winter 2020 issue of the Rookery!<br />
<br />
The building contest location is at <b>/warp holiday2020</b>.<br />
<br />
Multiple submissions are allowed, as well as co-ops. However, you can only receive a prize for one submission per contest. Everyone, from guests to builders to mods, are welcome to participate in all three contests. If you need to be set up with building permissions to take part in the building contest, reach out to a mod for help.<br />
<br />
All media are accepted for the fan art contest with the stipulation that the majority of the work must be your own. This means no stealing memes from the interwebs.<br />
<br />
Photoshop or other image-editing software enhancement (along the lines of saturation/color changes, depth of field blurs, custom backgrounds/skyboxes, etc.) are allowed in the screenshot contest. If you have a great shot lined up but have shoddy hardware and can’t use shaders, you are allowed to ask others for help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contest Prizes:<br />
The top three entries in each contest will win a lovely colored title in-game.<br />
<br />
And each first place winner of every contest will win up to <b>$40 USD of WesterosCraft merch</b> of their choice and a fancy trophy on the forums!</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Today <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/9009/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="9009" data-username="fluboss">fluboss</a>, myself, and a few other volunteers tested a reverse timelapse of one of Winterfell's towers to test out some ideas for a full-scale video.<br />
<br />
Most of you know what a timelapse is, but what is a<b> reverse</b> timelapse?<br />
Basically, we are filmed slowly destroying a build, top to bottom, and then the footage is reversed and sped up to make it look like its being built from nothing!<br />
<br />
As server builds nowadays take a long time to complete, they aren't really feasible as timelapses, but with the magic of a reverse timelapse we can simulate what that might look like. The first build we want to do a reverse timelapse for is <span style="color: rgb(40, 50, 78)"><b>Winterfell</b>.</span><br />
<br />
The time we are provisionally planning to do this is <b>9pm GMT (5pm EST), Saturday, September 19th.</b><br />
<br />
The filming will be coordinated using discord, by myself and fluboss, so please only join if you can access discord. You won't need to speak but you will need to hear me and fluboss as we organise the various shots.<br />
<br />
We will be posting more details in this thread about how we will organize the filming, in what order, and how.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you will join us by answering the poll above! That way we can get an idea of how many people might be interested.</div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">The spooky season is back! Already! Where did the year go?!<br />
we're up to the usual nonsense with a series of Halloween activities to keep us distracted from all...this*<i>gestures around vaguely</i>*.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: rgb(251, 160, 38)">Halloween</span> Contest!</b><br />
This is an easy one. Find the seven jack o'lanterns we've hidden around the seven spookiest locations in Westeros. Some will be easy but others will be a nightmare. First builder to take a screenshot with all seven will get a spooky <span style="color: rgb(251, 160, 38)">orange nickname flare</span> until Christmas.<br />

<b><span style="color: rgb(251, 160, 38)">Spookify</span> the <span style="color: rgb(243, 121, 52)">Red</span> Keep!</b><br />
As is tradition we're encouraging all builders to help with another Halloween takeover. This year we'll be decking the halls of the Red Keep, so go wild with decorating it with your scariest and most ghoulish creations (just don't break blocks and make it easy to clean up).<br />

      <title>Marker Signs!</title>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Aug 2020 14:56:57 +0000</pubDate>

      <dc:creator>DutchGuard</dc:creator>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bbWrapper">Thanks to the wizardry of <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/71/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="71" data-username="red">red</a> and the help of <a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/members/11/" class="username" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="11" data-username="mikeprimm">mikeprimm</a> we now have a lovely little addition to our Dynmap arsenal.<br />
<br />
Any builder (or higher rank) can now place signs on open plots or available minis which create Marker Flags on our Dynmap.<br />
<br />
For these to work the signs must be written in a specific way. At the moment you can designate either an available <b>[plot]</b> or available <b>[mini]</b><br />
<br />
Any text you write below either<b> [plot] </b>or <b>[mini]</b> will appear on the Dynmap marker.<br />
A sound and animation will play when you place the sign correctly.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/attachments/2020-08-26_09-14-33-png.4618/"
		target="_blank"><img src="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/data/attachments/4/4618-7719687d80962d9096e84c3538eb9aff.jpg"
		class="bbImage "
		style=""
		alt="2020-08-26_09.14.33.png"
		title="2020-08-26_09.14.33.png"
		width="100" height="57" loading="lazy" /></a><br />
Looks like this on the map:<br />
<a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/attachments/1598429913022-png.4619/"
		target="_blank"><img src="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/data/attachments/4/4619-470f752d954d22bb92cb054d45ff3a56.jpg"
		class="bbImage "
		style=""
		alt="1598429913022.png"
		title="1598429913022.png"
		width="100" height="56" loading="lazy" /></a><br />
<br />
When someone claims a plot, they can break the sign and the flag disappears! Neat right?<br />
<br />
When looking at the Dynmap make sure you have the &quot;Available Mini&quot; and &quot;Open Plot&quot; layers selected.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/attachments/1598433811899-png.4622/"
		target="_blank"><img src="https://forum.westeroscraft.com/data/attachments/4/4622-a78528e5cd5e5f7be85c722569bb436d.jpg"
		class="bbImage "
		style=""
		alt="1598433811899.png"
		title="1598433811899.png"
		width="45" height="100" loading="lazy" /></a><br />
<br />
My hope is that this is a much easier way to keep track of what is available and where, and might eventually make /warp build redundant. <br />
<br />
So, what are you waiting for? Go and mark those plots!</div>]]></content:encoded>

<br />
<b>THE GAME:</b><br />
Builders who want to play will be anonymously assigned another builder and their project to build a gift for.<br />
<br />
You’ll know who you’re building a gift for, but you won’t know who’s building one for you.<br />
<br />
You’ll be assigned who to build for and where to build it, and gifts will be opened on Christmas Day.<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br />
Enter your name, and your gift theme in the <span style="color: rgb(184, 49, 47)"><a href="https://forms.gle/NqY5JiniHS7toqLw9" target="_blank" class="link link--external" rel="noopener"><b>form linked here</b></a></span><br />
<br />
Project/Theme – This is what you’re telling your Secret Santa to build for you.<br />
<br />
We thought it would be fun if you made the theme your current project;<br />
For example:<br />
Name: Iwan<br />
Project/Theme: Harvest Hall<br />
So Iwan’s Secret Santa will make him a gift connected to Harvest Hall (Iwan’s not necessarily obligated to use it though <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite7" alt=":p" title="Stick Out Tongue    :p" loading="lazy" data-shortname=":p" />)<br />
<br />
You can make it any theme you want though, or you could just say “Surprise Me” if you don't currently have a project.<br />
<br />
Once we have enough entries, you’ll be messaged on the forum/in game mail telling you:<br />
<ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Who you're building for;</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">What their project/theme is; and</li>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul">Where you’re building it (you’ll be assigned a gift box at /warp secretsanta)</li>
</ul>We'll begin assigning Santas on the 15th, so we’re going to have to be speedy with this one, we'll keep pairing people up as they send in their details.<br />
<br />
Post here if you have questions.<br />
